Channel II: Time post-CEE to first SN

double-core leading to BBH?

Check out :
	- bhb.ICs function from ```import BinaryBHOrbit as bhb```
	- sph.getSPHParticles (this is the thing that uses healpix; also, it is where sometimes it goes wrong according to Sophie. Bad Aldo.)
	- sph.get_particle_properties

# AVG: Check what healpix is

Run icGadget_SNBinary.py, checkout it makes sense, make some plots.

Shall we use polytropes or stellar profiles?


Homework from Sophie:
- Read and understand `SphericalSPHDist.py`
- Change class c. to something more readably
- Change Collapsar name function
- Push shit to github
